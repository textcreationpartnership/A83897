            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Aſſembled, being according to our Duty ever Solicitous for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Increaſe of the Trade of this Kingdom, on which the Support of Your Majeſties Greatneſs and Honour ſo much depends, as well as the Security and Defence of Your People, have been very Apprehenſive, That the Steps lately made towards a Settlement of Your Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> at <hi>Darien,</hi> may tend to the great Prejudice of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and poſſibly to the Diſturbance of that Peace and good Correſpondence with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> which we conceive is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Advantagious to us all: We have therefore taken the ſame into our ſerious Conſideration, as a Matter of the greateſt Importance, and proper to be laid before Your Majeſty, as the Common Father of both Countreys. And as we are truly ſenſible of the great Loſſes our Neighbour Kingdom hath ſuſtained, both of Men and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, in their Expeditions to that Place, which we very heartily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo we ſhould not Endeavour, by any Interpoſition of ours, to Defeat the Hopes they may ſtill Entertain of Recovering thoſe Loſſes by their further Engaging in that Deſign, But that we judge ſuch a Proſecution on their Parts muſt end not only in far greater Diſappointments to themſelves, but at the ſame time prove very Inconvenient to the Trade and Quiet of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>On this Occaſion we humbly preſume to put Your Majeſty in mind of the Addreſs of both Houſes of Parliament, Preſented to Your Majeſty on the Seventeenth Day of <hi>December,</hi> 1695. In the Cloſe of which Addreſs Your Majeſty will ſee the Unanimous Senſe of this Kingdom in relation to any Settlement the <hi>Scots</hi> might make in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> by Virtue of an Act of Parliament paſt about that time in the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which was the Occaſion of the ſaid Addreſs.</p>
            <p>And we humbly Repreſent to Your Majeſty, That having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Information of ſome Orders Your Majeſty had ſent to the Governors of the Plantations on this Subject, this Houſe did on the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170894:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Eighteenth of <hi>January</hi> laſt, come to this Reſolution, That Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Pleaſure Signified to the Governors of the Plantations, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Scotch</hi>-Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> was agreeable to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of both Houſes of Parliament Preſented to Your Majeſty on the Seventeenth of <hi>December,</hi> 1695.</p>
            <p>And on the Eighth Day of this Inſtant <hi>February,</hi> this Houſe came to this further Reſolution, That the Settlement of the <hi>Scotch</hi>-Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at <hi>Darien</hi> is Inconſiſtent with the good of the Plantation-Trade of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>All which we humbly hope Your Majeſty will take into Your Royal Conſideration; and we are Confident that Your Majeſty cannot be thought too Partial to the Addreſs of this Houſe, if Your Majeſty ſhall in the firſt Place Conſider the Advantage and Good of the Trade of this Kingdom, by the Preſervation and Improvement of which, both theſe Kingdoms, and all Your other Dominions, muſt on all Occaſions Principally be Defended.</p>

            <p>His Majeſty having Received a very Dutiful Addreſs from the Houſe of Peers, in relation to the Endeavours lately uſed by ſome of His Majeſties Subjects of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> towards making a Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> in which they humbly Repreſent to Him their Opinion, That ſuch a Settlement is inconſiſtent with the Good of the Plantation-Trade of this Kingdom: Is Pleaſed to let the Houſe know, That He will always have a very great Regard to their Opinion; and to Aſſure them, That He will never be Wanting by all Proper Means to Promote the Advantage and Good of the Trade of <hi>England.</hi> At the ſame time His Majeſty is Pleaſed to Declare, That He cannot but have a great Concern and Tenderneſs for His Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a Deſire to Advance their Welfare and Proſperity, and is very ſenſibly Touched with the Loſs His Subjects of that Kingdom have ſuſtained, by their late unhappy Expeditions in order to a Settlement at <hi>Darien.</hi> His Majeſty does Apprehend, That Difficulties may too often ariſe with reſpect to the different Intereſts of Trade between His Two Kingdoms, unleſs ſome way be found out to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite them more nearly and compleatly: And therefore His Majeſty takes this Opportunity of putting the Houſe of Peers in mind of what He Recommended to His Parliament ſoon after His Acceſſion to the Throne, That they would conſider of a <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between the Two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms. His Majeſty is of Opinion, That nothing would more contribute to the Security and Happineſs of both Kingdoms; and is inclined to hope, That after they have lived near a Hundred Years under the ſame Head, ſome happy Expedient may be found for making them one People, in Caſe a Treaty were ſet on foot for that purpoſe; and therefore He does very earneſtly Recommend this Matter to the Conſideration of the Houſe.</p>
